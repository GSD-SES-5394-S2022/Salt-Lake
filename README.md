# Salt-Lake
This repository contains files generated for assignments and final report of course SES 5294. All projects are executed in R.

This project's site is the Salt Lake MSA. It studies how permanent closure of a major commercial street, Main Street, for pedestrian use and increased frequency of a bus route running parallel to the street affect travel behaviours within the studied area. The proposed closure stretches from South Temple to 400 South. In addition, the project changes the frequency of bus route 200 from 15 minutes to 5 minutes.

The repository is composed of following folders:
* _alternative_: demographic, employment and road network data of the proposed change.
* _exisiting_: demographic, employment and road network data udner status quo.
* _images_: graphs and diagrams to be used in written report.
* _zones_: geospatial data of the studied area other than the transportation network. 

Besides, the outmost layer stores the RMarkdown(.RMD) files with codes used to download, clean and analyze data, generate visualizations and build forecast models. Codes used for different assignments is compiled in FinalProject.RMD.
