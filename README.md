# Salt-Lake
This repository contains files generated for assignments and final report of course SES 5294. 

This project's site is the Salt Lake MSA. It studies how permanent closure of a major commercial street, Main Street, for pedestrian use and increased frequency of a bus route running parallel to the street affect travel behaviours within the studied area, including the change in accessibility, regional VMT, and route-level ridership etc. The proposed closure stretches from South Temple to 400 South. In addition, the project changes the frequency of bus route 200 from 15 minutes to 5 minutes.

The hypothesized change is built upon the successful implementation of Downtown SLC Open Streets, a program temporarily closes one block on the Main Street on the weekends (Thursday - Saturday) from 6-10 p.m. You can read more about the background for this project on the local newspapers [here]( https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/09/15/salt-lake-city-close/) and [here]( https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/04/28/salt-lake-city-will-close/).

The repository is composed of following contents:
* RMarkdowns: the outmost layer stores the RMarkdown(.RMD) files with codes used to download, clean and analyze data, generate visualizations and build forecast models. Codes used for different assignments are compiled into FinalProject.RMD.
* _alternative_ folder: demographic, employment and road network data of the proposed change.
* _exisiting_ folder: demographic, employment and road network data udner status quo.
* _images_ folder: graphs and diagrams to be used in written report.
* _zones_ folder: geospatial data of the studied area other than the transportation network.
