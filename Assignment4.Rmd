#Networks - Existing Scenario
This file determines the existing characteristics of the street and transit networks within Salt Lake MSA.

#Load relevant libraries


#Download an OpenStreetMap network
We represent the existing roadway network in a format that to allow us to calculate travel times. OpenStreetMaps is helpful for this.

#Convert an OSM file to a PBF file
You will be downloading OpenStreetMap data (and potentially editing it) in the .osm file format. To use it with the the the r5r package, youâ€™ll need to convert it to a .pbf file (which is just a compressed version of the *.osm file).

#Download a GTFS feed
We download data on the transit network in the GTFS format. 

#Generate skims
A skim is a matrix of travel times (or distances or costs) for all possible origin-destination pairs in your model. The R5R package is really useful for generating skims.
